# Book Index
# Given a list of ints representing page numbers return a string with the page numbers formatted as page ranges when the nums span a consecutive range.

# May want to do this in javascript

def book_index(nums):
    pass

nums1 = [1, 13, 14, 15, 37, 38, 70] # expected1 = "1, 13-15, 37-38, 70"
nums2 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # expected2 = "5-9"
nums3 = [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17] # expected3 = "1-3, 7, 9, 15-17"
