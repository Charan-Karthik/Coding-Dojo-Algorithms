# Coding-Dojo-Algorithms

<div>
As a part of Coding Dojo's full-time on-site (Silicon Valley location) software development coding bootcamp we practiced an algorithm first thing every morning for an hour. This repository includes my solutions for nearly all the algorithms we've covered (I forgot to document some algorithms as I went through the program, but this repository has most of them).

The solutions posted here were all whiteboarded; not all solutions had their code run in an IDE/text editor.
